Abstract

This research investigates the application of pre-trained transformer-based models, including BERT, XLM- RoBERTa, and DistilBERT, in the context of the EXIST 2023 shared task, which focuses on identifying and categorizing online sexism. The study emphasizes the crucial role of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in detecting harmful content, and it draws on previous competitions that have incorporated tasks to detect hate speech and abusive language. The methodology combines various advanced techniques from the text classification domain, including the use of additional datasets, data preprocessing, and model building. The research also explores data augmentation techniques and label encoding as preprocessing steps. The study’s findings indicate that the developed model performs optimally in English, and it suggests that the use of a voting system and the combination of outputs from multiple models contribute to the overall performance. The research concludes with a call for sustained initiatives to curb the prevalence of harmful content on digital platforms, and it outlines future work directions, including incorporating additional information about annotators, the assessment of annotator reliability, and exploring more sophisticated techniques for handling imbalances.
